# threejs-experiments
Just an initial basic experiment with WebGL and Three.js.

The fun stuff is all together in /js/prism-cube but in the /js/elements folder you can find separate files with more notes on each aspect.

Thanks to the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and the Sonar Systems [Three.js tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtjMdoYXLf6mvjCmrltvsD0j12ZQDMfE) for the inspiration to get started.

To have a look, in your terminal;
- `git clone https://github.com/Gingertonic/threejs-experiments.git`
- `cd threejs-experiments`
- and open in a simple server of your choice.
- eg. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser

But if you're short on time, here's a quick screen cap instead :)
